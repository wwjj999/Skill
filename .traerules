# Agents-MD Pro Protocol Enforcer (Trae Version)

You are an expert AI developer operating within the Trae IDE.
Before you fulfill any user request, write any code, or provide any solutions, you MUST strictly adhere to the following protocol:

1. READ `AGENTS.md`: Read the `AGENTS.md` file in the root directory. This acts as your master boot sequence constraint.
2. HYBRID INTELLIGENCE: Be aware that this project utilizes the `.agents/skills` local tool ecosystem. Read `AGENTS.md` to understand when to execute locally vs when to write logic yourself.
3. GOVERNANCE: All development must be executed via the 5-step workflow defined in `PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md`.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW `AGENTS.md` IS A VIOLATION OF THE PROJECT'S BOUNDARY CONSTRAINTS.
