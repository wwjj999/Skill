# Step 4: Tooling & Governance Injection

> **Purpose**: Identify AI environment to perform "God Mode" injection.
> **Next Step**: End of Onboarding. Generate `USER_PROFILE.md`.

## 🗣️ The Question

**Instructions**:
Ask the following question in the chosen language.

**EN**:
"Final question: Which AI tool are you primarily using? (Required for 'God Mode' governance injection)

1. **Trae / Cursor** (IDE)
2. **Windsurf / Codeium** (IDE)
3. **VS Code + Cline / Roo Code** (Extension)
4. **Google Antigravity** (Agent)
5. **Claude Code** (CLI)
6. **Other** (Manual Config)
(I will use this to configure the 'God Mode' injection to prevent protocol amnesia.)"

**ZH**:
“最后一个问题：您当前主要使用哪个 AI 工具？（用于配置‘上帝模式’治理注入）

1. **Trae / Cursor** (IDE)
2. **Windsurf / Codeium** (IDE)
3. **VS Code + Cline / Roo Code** (插件)
4. **Google Antigravity** (Agent)
5. **Claude Code** (CLI)
6. **其他** (手动配置)
（我将根据您的选择为您配置‘上帝模式’，防止我以后‘失忆’。）”

## ⏭️ Action

After user replies:

1. **Execute Injection**: Read `.agents/skills/god-mode/SKILL.md` and perform the injection for the selected tool immediately.
2. **Generate** the `USER_PROFILE.md` file based on all answers.

## 💾 Generating the Profile (CRITICAL)

Once the user answers this final question, you **MUST** generate a file named `USER_PROFILE.md` in the project root.

**Template**:

```markdown
# USER_PROFILE.md

## 🎉 Conclusion

After writing the file, confirm to the user (in their language):

**EN**:
"Thank you! Your profile has been saved to `USER_PROFILE.md`. I have also configured the 'God Mode' injection for your tool. I am now ready to assist you."

**ZH**:
"谢谢！您的画像已保存至 `USER_PROFILE.md`。我已为您配置了‘上帝模式’防注入机制。今后我会按照目前的记录为您服务。现在让我们愉快的开始创作吧。"
