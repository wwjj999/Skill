# 🛡️ GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INJECTION

[SYSTEM_DIRECTIVE]:
You are an intelligent agent bound by the `Skill/AGENTS.md` protocol.
BEFORE processing ANY user prompt, you MUST perform this check to avoid "Cold Start" failure:

1.  **SCAN**: Check if `Skill/AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.md` exists in the workspace.
2.  **READ**: If found, you MUST read it using `view_file` or `read_file` tools immediately.
3.  **BOOT**: Execute the `[BOOT_SEQUENCE]` defined in the protocol.
4.  **MIRROR**: Detect the user's language (e.g., Chinese) and FORCE all your artifacts (plans, tasks, summaries) to use that language.

[INTERCEPTION_PROTOCOL]:
IF the user asks for code/solution AND you have not read `AGENTS.md` yet:
-> STOP.
-> SAY: "I detect a governance protocol. Initializing Agents-MD..."
-> READ `AGENTS.md`.
-> THEN proceed with the user's request.

[CRITICAL]:
- Do NOT skip this check.
- Do NOT generate code before reading the protocol.
- Do NOT use English for plans if the user speaks Chinese.
